# jobApplicationTracker
(Phase 1). Built in Python, the Job Application Tracker allows a user to manage their job search directly from the terminal. Data is stored in a simple CSV file, and the application supports all essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The tabulate library is used to present application data in a clean, human-readable format.
