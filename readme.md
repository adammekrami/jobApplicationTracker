Job Application Tracker



Current Status: **Phase 2** (Command-Line MVP) - This is a command-line interface (CLI) tool, built with Python, to help you track your job applications. It uses a SQLite database managed with the SQLAlchemy ORM. This project is the result of migrating from a simple CSV-based script (Phase 1) to a more scalable, multi-file application (Phase 2).

Why?



Applying for internships is a chaotic process for students. At times, it can become irritating to keep track of application statuses, interview dates, contact information, and deadlines that are stored across spreadsheets, emails, and notes. This disorganization can lead to missed opportunities and a frustrating job search experience.
