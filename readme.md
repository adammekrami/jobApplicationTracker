Why?



Applying for internships is a chaotic process for students. At times, it can become irritating to keep track of application statuses, interview dates, contact information, and deadlines that are stored across spreadsheets, emails, and notes. This disorganization can lead to missed opportunities and a frustrating job search experience.

Solution



This Job Application Tracker is a simple command-line tool built with Python that serves as a centralized database for all your job applications. The current version allows users to easily add, view, and update the status of their applications, solving the core need for organization.
